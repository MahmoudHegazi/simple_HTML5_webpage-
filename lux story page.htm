<h1><strong>LUX</strong></h1>
<h2><em><q>The Lady Of Luminosity</q></em></h2>
<p>Luxanna Crownguard is a powerful young light mage from  Demacia, an insular realm where magical abilities are viewed  with fear and suspicion. Forced to keep her power secret for  much of her young life, she grew up fearing discovery and  exile, but learned to embrace her magic and covertly wields it  in service of her homeland.<br><br>
Luxanna - or Lux, as she preferred to be called - grew up in  the Demacian city of High Silvermere, one of two children born  to the prestigious Crownguard lineage; an honorific given to  the family tasked with protecting the king. Her grandfather  saved the king’s life at the Battle of Storm’s Fang, and her  father took up the mantle of protection during the Noxian  assault known as Cyrus’s Folly. Lux’s older brother, Garen, was  also expected to bear that honor.<br><br>

From the earliest age, both Lux and Garen were taught to fight,  to ride and to hunt. But where Garen chose to follow family  tradition to join the Dauntless Vanguard - one of Demacia’s  elite fighting regiments - Lux harbored dreams of venturing  beyond Demacia’s borders to explore the wider world. Her  parents frowned upon such notions, and as their only other  child, they expected her to take up the role of custodian and  defender of the family’s estates. While this was an important  duty, it was not what the idealistic and headstrong Lux  envisioned for her future. She idolized Garen, but railed  against his insistence that she put her ambitions aside and do  what was expected of her, as all Demacians should.<br><br>

Being told what to do did not sit well with young Lux, an  irrepressible girl with big ideas and bright dreams. To the  endless frustration of tutors who sought to prepare her for a  life of dutiful service to the family, Lux would question their  every teaching to pursue interesting new ideas, debate  differing perspectives and generally frustrate her tutors. Yet  it was impossible to be angry at Lux, her zest for life like an  inner radiance soothing even the most ruffled of feathers. Lux  had taken this state of affairs for granted, but with every  passing day she came to suspect this was more than just poetic  euphemism. The truth of what that meant finally came to light  when Lux was enjoying a solitary ride in the northern mountains  at dusk.<br><br>

As the last light of day sank in the west, her horse lost its  footing on a patch of ice and fell, breaking its foreleg. Lux  was stranded; too far from the nearest town to reach it before  nightfall, and too distraught at her mount’s pain to leave him.  She knew what Garen would say; kill the horse swiftly to end  its suffering. But Lux couldn’t bring herself to kill a mount  she had ridden since she was a child. As Lux prepared for a  night alone on the mountain, a lean and hungry sabrewulf pack,  scenting the horse’s blood, descended from their dens in search  of fresh meat.<br><br>

As night fell and Lux had still not returned home, her father  and Garen rode out to find her. They searched all night, and  eventually found her the next morning, shivering and alone next  to her frightened horse. The corpses of six sabrewulfs  surrounded her, their fur scorched and flesh seared. Lux  refused to speak of what happened and begged her father to  rescue her beloved steed. A wagon was dispatched from the  family home, and the horse was saved as Lux nursed it back to  health.<br><br>

Since that night, Lux knew she possessed abilities beyond those  of everyone around her; abilities the people of magic-averse  Demacia would view with hatred. Since a babe in arms, Lux had  been taught that magic had once brought Runeterra to the edge  of annihilation. Her own uncle had been slain by a mage, and  Demacia’s folktales were replete with stories portraying  sorcerers as twisted servants of evil, that told of how even  the purest heart could be corrupted by magic. Would she become  evil? Was she an abomination to be killed or exiled beyond the  great wall? Fear and doubt gnawed at Lux, and she spent many  nights squeezing her eyes closed, clenching her fists to stop  the light rippling from her skin.<br><br>

The terror that there was something wrong with her almost  crushed her spirit. But after a strange night in the capital of  Demacia when Lux was thirteen years old - a night where it was  said a great stone colossus walked abroad in the darkness - she  returned to High Silvermere with a fresh perspective on her  powers.<br><br>

The Crownguards left Garen in the capital to train with the  Dauntless Vanguard, and Lux only saw her brother on his rare  visits to High Silvermere, their relationship becoming more  distant with each return. Upon Lux’s return home, she was  determined to embrace her powers, not fear them. To the eternal  consternation of her bodyguards, she regularly managed to evade  them and ride away for hours at a time, far from judging eyes.  Alone in the wild forests, she would give free rein to her  magic, gradually learning to better control it. Finally she was  free to let her powers loose in all their wild majesty. She  could bend light to blind and confuse, bring forth radiance  upon the palm of her hand or summon illuminated figures from  thin air. She could also craft light so intense that it could  burn and destroy. Once, these powers had frightened her, but  now she reveled in them, joyous as she was finally able to  fully express herself.<br><br>

Yet even as she understood more of her powers, Lux knew she  still had much to learn. Many times over the next few years,  Lux was often the epicenter of curious phenomena within  Crownguard Manor; dancing lights appearing throughout the  castle, statuary reciting limericks to passersby, or giggling  laughter where no one could be seen. Her family always found  ways to explain away such events, and turned a blind eye to  their obvious source. To confront the reality of what was  happening would be to acknowledge a painful truth and expose  the family to unwanted attention. Seeking to ground Lux in the  realities of the world, her mother took her on regular tours of  the Crownguard estates, visiting the many families under their  protection. Despite her initial reluctance to take on this  duty, Lux quickly became known as someone who would always  listen, and always do whatever she could to help her people in  times of adversity.<br><br>

At the age of sixteen, Lux and her family traveled to the  capital city of Demacia for a month to witness Garen’s  investiture into the ranks of the Dauntless Vanguard. While in  the capital, she continued her altruistic efforts, working to  help those in need alongside a charitable religious order of  Demacia known as the Illuminators. In the capital, as in High  Silvermere, Lux made a name for herself as a young woman of  immense kindness and great wit. During her stay, she befriended  a knight of the Radiant Ones, the warrior order of the  Illuminators, named Kahina. She regularly sparred with Kahina  between the many balls and functions she was expected to attend  with her family, quickly establishing a deep bond with the  warrior woman.<br><br>

But as each night fell, Lux’s zestful streak once again came to  the fore, and she would use her powers to slip beyond the city  walls. Demacia had beguiled Lux with its beauty, but on one  exploration to a village in the shadow of a wild forest, she  was to learn that darkness can take root even in the brightest  garden.<br><br>

Lux stumbled upon a nest of flesh-eating creatures preying upon  the village’s inhabitants and tracked them to their forest  lair. The creatures dwelled in a subterranean cave system  filled with gnawed bones, and, seized by a sense of youthful  invulnerability and wrathful indignation, she attacked with  coruscating blasts of searing magic. Lux killed dozens of the  monsters, but, in her impetuousness, she had underestimated  their numbers and the creatures soon overwhelmed her. Just  before the monsters tore out her throat, a cadre of Radiant  Ones who had also been tracking these monsters attacked the  lair and put them to the sword. The leader of these warriors  was Kahina. And she had seen what Lux could do.<br><br>

Lux was escorted back to Demacia and presented to the innermost  circle of the Illuminators. Here, she was given a stark choice.  Use her powers beyond Demacia’s borders to learn of its enemies  or be exiled forever as a wielder of magic. That Demacia had an  order willing to use magic came as a shock to Lux, but the  choice they offered was too enticing to refuse. Lux readily  accepted. Her parents returned to High Silvermere, told only  that their daughter had been seconded to serve the crown and  would remain in Demacia to join the ranks of the Radiant Ones.  They were surprised, but pleased Lux had finally found her  place in Demacia.<br><br>

Lux remained in the capital for a number of years, training  with the Radiant Ones and learning from the Illuminators before  taking on her first mission. She was to infiltrate the  contested lands between eastern Demacia and the Noxian empire  to investigate signs that enemy agents were attempting to unite  these buffer states against Demacia. Lux’s mission was a  complete success and the nefarious plot failed, the fragile  alliances being brokered by Noxian agents collapsing in a  flurry of betrayals and deceit. Further missions followed, each  one cementing Lux’s reputation as someone who could get the job  done, no matter how difficult.<br><br>

Beyond Demacia’s walls, Lux learned more of the world and saw  its rich diversity, storied history and myriad peoples. She  came to understand that the Demacian way was not the only way,  able now to recognize its flaws as well as its boons. While  away from her homeland, Lux can freely wield her powers, but  keeps them hidden when she returns home to visit her parents  and Garen. To her brother and family, she is a loyal servant of  Demacia... which is true, just not in a manner they would ever  expect.</p>
